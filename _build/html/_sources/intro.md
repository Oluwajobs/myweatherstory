# Introduction

This is a sample lesson on how you can use the Pi-WRF application to teach learners about weather forecasting and its real world application. I hope this will inspire you to create, teach and share your own lessons about weather and the atmosphere using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model on micro-computers like the Raspberry Pi.

You can explore similar lessons others have created on the [Pi-WRF Teaching Boxes page](https://ncar.github.io/teaching-boxes). For support and more information on Pi-WRF visit the [NCAR Pi-WRF repository](https://ncar.github.com/pi-wrf) repository.

Now let's dive into the lesson. Click the "Lesson Overview" button to begin.

## Vocabulary:

- **Supercomputers:**
A supercomputer is an incredibly fast and powerful computer that helps scientists and researchers solve complex problems and analyze large amounts of data more quickly and efficiently than regular computers. Visit the [IBM Supercomputing website](https://www.ibm.com/topics/supercomputing) to learn more about supercomputers.

- **Raspberry Pi:** 
A low cost micro-controller that plugs into a screen
and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. Visit the [Raspberry Pi website](https://www.raspberrypi.org) to learn more.

- **Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model:** 
The WRF model is a computer program that uses lots of information like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and air pressure to  predict the weather. Learn more about WRF [here](https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/models/wrf).

- **Forecasting:** 
The process of estimating or predicting future events
(e.g., rain, traffic, stock)

- **Domain:** 
The geographical area you want to make a weather forecast
about.
