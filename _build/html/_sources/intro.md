# Introduction

This is a sample lesson on how you can use the Pi-WRF application to teach learners about weather forecasting and its real world application. I hope this will inspire you to create, teach and share your own lessons about weather and the atmosphere using the weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model on micro-computers like the Raspberry Pi.

You can explore similar lessons others have created on the [Pi-WRF Teaching Boxes page](https://ncar.github.io/teaching-boxes). For support and more information on Pi-WRF visit the [NCAR Pi-WRF repository](https://ncar.github.com/pi-wrf) repository.
