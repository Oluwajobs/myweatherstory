**Standards:**

MS - ESS2-5: Using weather data to explore changes in weather conditions due to air masses motion and interaction.

HS - ESS2-4: Use models to describe how variations in energy flow affect climate

MS - ESS2-6: Develop and use a model to describe unequal heating and rotation of the earth determines regional climate change.

HS - ESS3-5: Analyze geoscience data and use results from global climate models to make forecast. 

# What Next?

You can improve this activity my encouraging your students to research and use different weather features to make decision about a particular driving question. Afterwards, they can compare their results and decisions and explore the similarities or differences between them.

For example, some set of learners could answer this particular lesson using Temperature and Rainfall plots while others would use Windspeed and humidity!
