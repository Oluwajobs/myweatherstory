# Scenario:

Itâ€™s not easy to dress well in unusual weather conditions, even though
your wardrobe is filled with multiple items. Imagine you are going on a
vacation and you need to decide on the best clothes you need to take
along with you during this trip. That is where weather forecasts come in
handy. By making a weather forecast you can get an overview of how the
weather would look and choose the best clothing without being affected
by the weather. This helps save your time and solves the headache of
what to wear.
