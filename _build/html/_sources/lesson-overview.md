## Weather Forecasting

The weather plays a critical role in every aspect of human life. Hence,
scientists have made efforts over the years to improve humanâ€™s ability
and accuracy to predict the weather in order to ensure a better life.
This process of weather prediction using various scientific and
computational tools is referred to as *weather forecasting*.

Weather Forecasting is done by using supercomputers to collect and
process large amounts of data about the atmosphere and applying
scientific models to make informed decisions from the data.

## Why Predict The Weather?

The ultimate goal of weather forecasting is to protect humans and
improve our quality of life by using data about the atmosphere to make
informed decisions about agriculture, tourism, healthcare, hurricanes,
safety and other daily activities. In this lesson you will be making
your own weather predictions by running the Weather Research and
Forecasting (WRF) model on a Raspberry Pi. You will use this prediction
to answer a question you care about and share your weather story with
the others.

## Purpose and Objective

The objective of this lesson is to introduce students to weather
forecasting and model simulation using the wrf model. At the end of the
lesson, learners will be able to:

1.  use weather datasets and the WRF model to answer real world
    questions.

2.  apply data science practices (data understanding, analysis,
    visualization, and communication) to tell a weather story.

3.  Analyze and reflect on the social impact of weather forecasting

## Preparation Materials/Resources

-   RaspberryPi 3+ or higher, with monitor and keyboard

-   Internet connection to download weather data
