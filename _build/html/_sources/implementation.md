# Using Pi-WRF To Answer Our Driving Question

The following steps demonstrate how to use the Pi-WRF application to answer our driving question: What types of clothes should I take along for my vacation based on the weather forecast?

## Step 1: Understand the Weather Data Problem Scenario

The first step is to present the weather scenario to the learners and
help them see how it is connected to their daily lives. Helping to make
real world connections is very important in this step and a good
scenario could set the tone. Teachers can use different relevant
real-life examples to help learners make the necessary connections
between weather forecasting and their society.

In this lesson, we are trying to use weather data to make predictions
about the weather for the next XX days in order to be able to decide the
best clothes to prepare and wear during these days.
