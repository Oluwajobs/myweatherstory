# Step 2: Brainstorm Question and Set Boundaries

## 2.1 Brainstorm Driving Question

The next step is to brainstorm the driving question with your learners
and decide the best way you think the question should be answered. By
taking a quick glance at the data, you will be able to determine the
different features or variables that are available to you. There are six
(6) main components of weather including: temperature, atmospheric
pressure, wind, humidity, precipitation, and cloudiness. Together with
your students, you will need to decide which of these components will be
used to answer your research question.

In this lesson, I will be using temperature forecasts to answer my
driving question.

```{note}
The WRF model that we will be using makes predictions for all
these weather features. However, I suggest using just one feature per
lesson.
```

## 2.2 Setting Boundaries

### <u>Decide location:</u>

Before you start using the WRF model to make forecasts, you will need to
decide on a location (also known as domain) you want to explore. Decide
this with your learners and take note of the latitude and longitude of
the location you chose.

In this lesson, I will be making a weather forecast for the City of
Boulder, Colorado with latitude and longitude of 40.0150 and -105.2705
respectively.

### <u>Decide date and time range:</u>

Next you will need to decide the date and time range you intend to make
a weather forecast for. At the moment, the WRF model can make accurate
weather predictions for 7 to 10 days.
