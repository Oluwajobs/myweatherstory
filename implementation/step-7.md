# Step 7: Tell Your Weather Story

Now is the time to get creative and tell your weather story! Using your
weather predictions, plots and vacation plans you can now tell a story
about how your vacation plans and clothes were shaped by your
forecasting. Teachers can engage learners in this activity in a variety
of ways. For example, kids could tell a picture story, Draw infographics
or create a video.

In this lesson, I have chosen to tell my weather story using the
infographic below.
